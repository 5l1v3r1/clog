Clog is a library of charged particle stopping powers and related Coulomb logarithm
processes in a plasma. The stopping power is a particularly useful quantity for
plasma physics, as it measures the energy loss of per unit length of charged particle
as it traverses a plasma, and this directly influences the plasma
heating. Clog's primary stopping power is the BPS (Brown-Preston-Singleton)
theory.
